Some checks on DDF requests


Hi Saurabh and Friends,

I have been thinking about the DDF ocean approach, and wanted to write with some thoughts.

First, thank you for kindly considering our previous inputs and making some changes critical for AGN science. These are a good start.

I will put my further thoughts below, in response to what you write for clarity. Happy to clarify over Zoom if useful, since this discussion can become technical quickly.

   • timing of deep seasons (right now COSMOS gets 3 deep seasons early, EDFS_a and EDFS_b are also early for Euclid synergy, and others are done one per year afterwards, but there is flexibility here)

In terms of complementarity with much other multiwavelength data and characterizing well large AGN samples, obtaining deep seasons earlier for CDF-S and XMM-LSS would be helpful - this would be better than doing three early deep seasons all on COSMOS. Note that CDF-S also has superb Euclid synergy. Could this change please be made?

For comparison, the multiwavelength data for EDFS_a and EDFS_b are much less well developed. So, better to focus on several well-developed fields earlier, especially CDF-S and XMM-LSS, so that people have more time to build up EDFS_a and EDFS_b.

   • any adjustment requested to filter balance of shallow epochs (u:3 g:2 r:2 i:2 z:2 y:2 visits) or deep epochs (u:8 g:4 r:18 i:55 z:52 y:20 visits) — note that any requested increase in these would have to be balanced by a decrease somewhere (in visits/season length/cadence)

The AGN SC request in our white papers was u:4 g:1 r:1 i:3 z:5 y:4.

In shallow seasons, g:1 i:3 and r:1 z:3 would be closer to our request (compared to g:2 i:2 and r:2 z:2). Possible?

Also, as we discussed on the AGN SC teleconference, in shallow seasons you will actually get gi+(u,y) and rz+(u,y) where "(u,y)" notation means either u or y, depending upon what is in the filter wheel. Do you confirm? We would like the (u,y) to be in time domain along with the gi and rz - possible? We need as much band coverage as possible with good temporal coverage.

Similarly, during deep seasons, we would like to get the best-possible temporal coverage of u and y - possible?

For deep seasons, the u:8 g:4 r:18 i:55 z:52 y:20 band balance is not ideal for AGN science either, compared to our white paper request. Is it possible to add more depth in u?

   • any suggestions for u and y cadence changes? (u and y are scheduled independently from griz because of filter availability)

As above, it will be helpful to have (u,y) in time domain, so that we get the best possible temporal coverage in these filters. Agreed?

Some other important general points:

* The DDFs should be centered at the positions listed in Sec 3.2 of Br18.

* DDF observations should minimize nightly lunar sky-brightness effects to the extent reasonably possible (see "Cadence" of Br21).

* DDF observations should extend over the very longest observing seasons possible (7-8.5 months; see Br18 and Br21). An accordion cadence approach could be used to enable this at lower cost, if needed.

* To mitigate weather or other losses, if no observations can be made in a given night then we request elevated priority for the next night to make up the loss (see Sec 3.7 of Br18).
